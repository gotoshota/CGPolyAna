# Coarse-Grained Polymer Analyser
This repository provides Fortran modules and some executable binaries to analyze trajectory from molecular dynamics simulation of coarse-grained polymer (bead-spring model).
## Examples
You can easily compute mean square displacement (MSD) and mean square radius of gyration (Rg2) in `examples` directory.
### compile 
```
cd path/to/CGPolyAna
cd examples
make clean
make
```
